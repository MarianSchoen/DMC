Description: Deconvolute given RNA-Seq bulks using scRNA-Seq profiles and a list
  of models. Models must be provided as functions from the user. 
  In addition, perform different benchmarks by deconvolving artificial bulks 
  created from single-cell data, including deconvolution with different gene 
  sets, dependency on training data and simulated subtypes. The user has the 
  option to exclude cell types from the reference or the simulated bulks.
