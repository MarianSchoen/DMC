Description: Deconvolute given RNA-Seq bulks using scRNA-Seq profiles and a list
  of algorithms. Algorithms can be chosen from a list of implemented algorithms
  or supplied by the user as functions. In addition, perform different benchmarks
  by deconvolving artificial bulks created from single-cell data, including
  deconvolution with different gene sets, dependency on training data and
  simulated subtypes. The user has the option to exclude cell types from the
  reference or the simulated bulks.
