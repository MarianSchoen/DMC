Description: Deconvolve given RNA-Seq bulks using sRNA-Seq profiles and a list of algorithms. 
	Algorithms can be chosen from a list of implemented algorithms or supplied by the user as functions.
	In addition, perform different benchmark by deconvolving artificial bulks created from single-cell data,
	including deconvolution with different gene sets, dependency on training data and simulated subtypes. 
	The user has the option to exclude cell types from the reference or the simulated bulks.
